		<h1>Fumbles</h1>
		<div class="items">
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overpower</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up, you realise it's growing out of control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but a surge of power makes you lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and you are knocked prone. Any subsequent targets this ability would hit are automatically missed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Slip up</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					While stringing up your bow, you let the string slip from your hands. This causes your aim to be way off. One of your allies takes an arrow to the knee.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You let go of the sling way too early, and the projectile flies off in the direction of one of your allies. Fortunately, the sling was not yet spinning at full speed.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You spend too much time worrying about the spell and too little time focussing energy in the correct direction. A mental image of an ally pops into your mind.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and sizzles off into the direction of your closest ally. They take half damage, other effects of your attack do not apply.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overconfidence</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You proudly take aim at your foe to smite him down with a single arrow. A feeling of shame overcomes you after you completely miss your target and the arrow is not even remotely close to your original target…
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You start swinging your weapon to show of your skills before your party and confidently walk towards your enemy. As you take your swing your enemy easily dodges your attempt to hit him causing you to only hit air.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You proudly declare to your party that you will knock your enemies prone with enormous power by a single attack. Laughter arises from your own party as your attack doesn’t even seem to effect the enemy after you just enchanted a spell during the last 2 minutes
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you take a -3 penalty on your next attack roll due to a lack of confidence.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Greasy hands</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You make a grotesque attack with your weapon, only to find out your hands been sweating too much. Before the strike lands, you lose grip of your weapon and send it flying to infinity, and beyond.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					Your light and swift strike would have cut your enemy clear in two. As you hear the sound of metal hitting the floor in the distance, you suddenly realise why your stroke had felt so light.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					As you prepare for the shot of a lifetime, the centrifugal power of the sling suddenly overcomes the power of friction between the sling itself and your fingers.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you launch your weapon 1[W] squares in the direction of your target. If your weapon lands on an enemy, they take 1d4 of damage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Daft Moment</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You are unable to think clearly and cannot focus on your spell. The frustration of this causes you to lose track of time as you stubbornly keep trying to cast the spell, and the spell does none the better for it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As you call upon divine providence to slay your enemies, nothing happens. You try to plead with your gods, but your prayers remain unanswered. For a moment, you simply stand there doubting yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you prepare to draw the power from the spirits of nature that is required for your next feat, you find it lacking. You focus so hard that, for a moment, you lose track of everything around you, but still, nothing happens.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you become unable to use any abilities besides basic attacks. You may spend a minor action to re-focus and get rid of this effect. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Cut the Cheese</h2>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
					As you prepare to make your strike, suddenly, your bowels rebel. You let out a righteous fart whose sound echoes through the area like a horn blast in a valley. Shocked, you abort your attack and take a moment to recover.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses. Make a secondary attack: close burst 7; Allies and enemies that have noses; Level vs. Fortitude; Hit: target must use a movement action of their next turn to move at least 3sq away from you if they can.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Arise, King Arthur!</h2>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					As you attack your enemy with full power,he deflects the attack with his shield causing the blade of your sword to get stuck in a cavity in the wall behind him...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You charge into your enemy while shouting "it's clobbering time" and start swinging your weapon in all directions causing you to hit more ground than anything.  You face plant into the ground as your weapon gets wedged between some boulders and you fail to notice this on time.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					as a minor action during any turn, you can make a DC20 + &frac12;lv Strength check to succesfully pull your weapon back out of the ground.
				</p>
			</div>
			
		</div>
		
		<h1>Criticals</h1>
		<div class="items">
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Intimidation</h2>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					You unleash divine wrath upon the enemy. Awed by your tremendous show of force, they suddenly become very aware of their own mortality.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					Your magic power surges and the sound of your spell strikes fear into the heart of your enemies, compelling them to run while they still can.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					A heavy blow to the very skull of the enemy makes a dent they will not ever recover from. As you roar with rage, your enemies are crippled with fear.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					<span class="special">If the target is dead, use area burst 2 centered on target.</span>
					<br />
					Your attack deals maximum damage. Make an additional attack: Level vs. Will. Hit: target is affected by fear until the start of your next turn.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>The flow of battle</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					As you notice your arrow going straight for its mark, you confidently draw up and aim the next one without even thinking about it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					As your blade cleanly slices through the enemy's abdomen, you use the motion of your swing to prepare your next strike.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					After releasing the bullet from your sling, you reload it with a swift sleight of hand, preparing your next attack in no time.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Roll your damage twice and use the best result. Until the end of your next turn, you may use a minor action as a free action once.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Power Surge</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					As you weave your spell, you can feel the power surging through you. Through careful adaptation, you are able to use this arcane disturbance to your advantage, unleashing havoc on your enemies.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					You can feel the divine power coursing through your veins. After a split second of silent thankfulness to the divines, you channel it to perform one of your grandest feats yet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					For a split second, it seems as though your call for aid is unheard, but then, suddenly, you feel enormous primal power welling up from inside, almost overtaking you, but you manage to stay in control.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack does maximum damage. Make an arcana, religion or nature check. If the result is higher than 15, add the result - 15 to the damage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Bloodlust</h2>
				<p class="flavor any">
					
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
					You score a critical hit against your opponent. The brutality of the blow makes you hungry for more. You smile wickedly and engage with a lust for blood.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
					
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack deals maximum damage. Until your next critical hit, treat your weapon as if it was high crit.<br />
					<span class="special">If it already is high crit, crit on rolls of 18+ instead of 19+.</span>
				</p>
