		<h1>Fumbles</h1>
		<div class="items">
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overpower</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up, you realise it's growing out of control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but a surge of power makes you lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and you are knocked prone. Any subsequent targets this ability would hit are automatically missed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Slip up</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					While stringing up your bow, you let the string slip from your hands. This causes your aim to be way off. One of your allies takes an arrow to the knee.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You let go of the sling way too early, and the projectile flies off in the direction of one of your allies. Fortunately, the sling was not yet spinning at full speed.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You spend too much time worrying about the spell and too little time focussing energy in the correct direction. A mental image of an ally pops into your mind.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and sizzles off into the direction of your closest ally. They take half damage, other effects of your attack do not apply.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overconfidence</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You proudly aim at your foe, prepared to smite them down with a single arrow. A feeling of shame overcomes you as you completely miss your target, your arrow not even going in its general direction.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You start swinging your weapon around to show off your skills and confidently strut towards your enemy. As you swing wide, your enemy easily dodges your attempt to hit and you shamefully slice into the air.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You proudly declare to your party that you will knock your enemies prone with enormous power in this single attack. Laughter arises from your party as your attack your attempt at spell-weaving results in utter failure.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Your attack misses this and any subsequent targets. You take a -2 penalty on your next attack roll due to a short-lived lack of confidence.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Greasy hands</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You make a grotesque attack with your weapon, only to find out your hands been sweating too much. Before the strike lands, you lose grip of your weapon and send it flying to infinity, and beyond.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					Your light and swift strike would have cut your enemy clear in two. As you hear the sound of metal hitting the floor in the distance, you suddenly realise why your stroke had felt so light.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					As you prepare for the shot of a lifetime, the centrifugal power of the sling suddenly overcomes the power of friction between the sling itself and your fingers.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you launch your weapon 1[W] squares in the direction of your target. If your weapon lands on an enemy, they take 1d4 of damage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Daft Moment</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You are unable to think clearly and cannot focus on your spell. The frustration of this causes you to lose track of time as you stubbornly keep trying to cast the spell, and the spell does none the better for it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As you call upon divine providence to slay your enemies, nothing happens. You try to plead with your gods, but your prayers remain unanswered. For a moment, you simply stand there doubting yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you prepare to draw the power from the spirits of nature that is required for your next feat, you find it lacking. You focus so hard that, for a moment, you lose track of everything around you, but still, nothing happens.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you become unable to use any abilities besides basic attacks. You may spend a minor action to re-focus and get rid of this effect. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Unfavorable mixture</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					As you call on the elements to cast your next spell, you soon realise that you have made a horrible mistake in the composition. Unable to control it any longer you are forced to cast it upon yourself to save your allies.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As your first plead for godly intervention wasn't granted, you selfishly call upon another to slay the enemy before you. You are smitten by the anger of the original for your lack of loyalty towards them.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you gather the energy from your surroundings a disturbance causes your primal power to backfire, causing you to get hit by it yourself.

			<div class="item">
				<h2>Sneeze</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					Mid-combat, you find yourself unable to suppress the urge to have a big sneeze. As snot covers your armor, you are forced to pause and lower your weapons for a second.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					Just as you start to cast your spell, your concentration gets drawn away. A huge explosion of snot signifies the failure of what would have been a sure hit.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor psionic">

			<div class="item">
				<h2>Burn - Out</h2>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
					You feel your mind faltering, but you refuse to give in to such small things. You draw out all your remaining power to make a strong attack, but your mind can't handle the strain. Suddenly, everything goes black...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					Your bond with nature is strong, but your technique is wavering and your spirit tired. You decide to press on and ignore your instincts. You are able to unlease one mighty blow, but then, everything fades away...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					Your devotion is unwavering, but your physical body cannot keep up with the divine energy flowing through it. You choose to ignore the earthly and channel up one final feat of divinity before your body finally gives in.

				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You charge into your enemy shouting "it's clobbering time!" while swinging your weapon wildly. It seems that control sometimes does matter. You face-plant into the ground as your weapon gets wedged between some boulders.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you are disarmed. As a minor action during any turn, you can make a [DC 20 + &frac12; Level] Strength check. If it is successful, you pull your weapon back out of the ground.

			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Ricochet</h2>
				<p class="flavor sling">

				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">

				</p>

				<h2>Twisted Ankle</h2>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You slide through the battlefield like a knife through butter. However, sudden pain overcomes you when you twist your ankle by turning too sharp.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					In a surge of battle rage, your weapon feels light as a feather, but as you make a wide swing, your feet can scarcely handle the weight and power. You twist your ankle and stumble.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
