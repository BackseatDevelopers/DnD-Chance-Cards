		<h1>Fumbles</h1>
		<div class="items">
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overpower</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up, you realise it's growing out of control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but a surge of power makes you lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and you are knocked prone. Any subsequent targets this ability would hit are automatically missed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Slip up</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					While stringing up your bow, you let the string slip from your hands. This causes your aim to be way off. One of your allies takes an arrow to the knee.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You let go of the sling way too early, and the projectile flies off in the direction of one of your allies. Fortunately, the sling was not yet spinning at full speed.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You spend too much time worrying about the spell and too little time focussing energy in the correct direction. A mental image of an ally pops into your mind.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and sizzles off into the direction of your closest ally. They take half damage, other effects of your attack do not apply.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Cut the Cheese</h2>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
					As you prepare to make your strike, suddenly, your bowels rebel. You let out a righteous fart whose sound echoes through the area like a horn blast in a valley. Shocked, you abort your attack and take a moment to recover.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses. Make a secondary attack: close burst 7; Allies and enemies that have noses; Level vs. Fortitude; Hit: target must use a movement action of their next turn to move at least 3sq away from you if they can.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overconfidence</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You proudly aim at your foe, prepared to smite them down with a single arrow. A feeling of shame overcomes you as you completely miss your target, your arrow not even going in its general direction.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You start swinging your weapon around to show off your skills and confidently strut towards your enemy. As you swing wide, your enemy easily dodges your attempt to hit and you shamefully slice into the air.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You proudly declare to your party that you will knock your enemies prone with enormous power in this single attack. Laughter arises from your party as your attack your attempt at spell-weaving results in utter failure.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Your attack misses this and any subsequent targets. You take a -2 penalty on your next attack roll due to a short-lived lack of confidence.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Greasy hands</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You make a grotesque attack with your weapon, only to find out your hands been sweating too much. Before the strike lands, you lose grip of your weapon and send it flying to infinity, and beyond.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					Your light and swift strike would have cut your enemy clear in two. As you hear the sound of metal hitting the floor in the distance, you suddenly realise why your stroke had felt so light.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					As you prepare for the shot of a lifetime, the centrifugal power of the sling suddenly overcomes the power of friction between the sling itself and your fingers.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you launch your weapon 1[W] squares in the direction of your target. If your weapon lands on an enemy, they take 1d4 of damage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Daft Moment</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You are unable to think clearly and cannot focus on your spell. The frustration of this causes you to lose track of time as you stubbornly keep trying to cast the spell, and the spell does none the better for it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As you call upon divine providence to slay your enemies, nothing happens. You try to plead with your gods, but your prayers remain unanswered. For a moment, you simply stand there doubting yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you prepare to draw the power from the spirits of nature that is required for your next feat, you find it lacking. You focus so hard that, for a moment, you lose track of everything around you, but still, nothing happens.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you become unable to use any abilities besides basic attacks. You may spend a minor action to re-focus and get rid of this effect. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>I meant to do that!!</h2>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
					You miss your attack, stumble over your own feet and into the enemy, fall down, land harshly on your shoulder, tumble forward and somehow, unintentionally, make it back to your feet. Your allies seem impressed!
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses. The DM shifts your character 1sq. Any enemies adjacent to either square take 1d4 damage. You take 1d8 damage for every five levels you have gained.<br />
					<span class="special">(1d8 at lv1, 2d8 at lv6, 3d8 at lv11, ...)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Sneeze</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					Mid-combat, you find yourself unable to suppress the urge to have a big sneeze. As snot covers your armor, you are forced to pause and lower your weapons for a second.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					Just as you start to cast your spell, your concentration gets drawn away. A huge explosion of snot signifies the failure of what would have been a sure hit.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
					As you start to focus inward on your mental energy. Suddenly, you lift your head, but instead of unleashing hell upon your enemies, you unleash a large wad of booger upon yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses. You grant combat advantage to all enemies until the start of your next turn. You take 1 acid damage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Burn - Out</h2>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
					You feel your mind faltering, but you refuse to give in to such small things. You draw out all your remaining power to make a strong attack, but your mind can't handle the strain. Suddenly, everything goes black...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					Your bond with nature is strong, but your technique is wavering and your spirit tired. You decide to press on and ignore your instincts. You are able to unlease one mighty blow, but then, everything fades away...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					Your devotion is unwavering, but your physical body cannot keep up with the divine energy flowing through it. You choose to ignore the earthly and channel up one final feat of divinity before your body finally gives in.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack deals maximum damage. All subsequent attacks are prevented (including effects on miss). You fall unconscious (saving throw ends). You take a -1 penalty to all attack rolls until your next extended rest.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="item">
				<h2>Arise, King Arthur!</h2>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					As you attack your enemy with full power,he deflects the attack with his shield causing the blade of your sword to get stuck in a cavity in the wall behind him...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You charge into your enemy while shouting "it's clobbering time" and start swinging your weapon wildly. It seems that control sometimes does matter. You face-plant into the ground as your weapon gets wedged between some boulders and you fail to notice this on time.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					as a minor action during any turn, you can make a DC20 + &frac12;lv Strength check to succesfully pull your weapon back out of the ground.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="item">
				<h2>Ricochet</h2>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You fire a shot with your sling towards one of your enemies but your lack of aim causes you to miss the target completely. The stone ricochets off a wall right back into your face.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You leap into battle; fearless as you are; but your weapon ricochets off your enemies shield causing you to smash your own foot.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">

				<p class="effect">
					Roll your damage as if you had hit your target and apply it to yourself.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<h2>That twist...</h2>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You slide through the battlefield as a knife through butter. However, sudden pain overcomes you when you twist your ankle by turning to sharp.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					In a surge of battle rage, your weapon feels light as a feather. A wide swing however soon remembers you thatit is certainly not as you slam into the ground because of the weight of it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Twist ankle; Slowed for 10 rounds, Dex check DC 20 or fall Prone. 
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overwhelmed</h2>
				<p class="flavor range">
					While you have the mighty foe in your cross-hair, your foe releases a mighty battle roar. You cower backwards in fear. A soiling spell won't have any use any more...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor melee">

			<div class="item">
				<h2>My eyes!</h2>

					You could not have a more clean shot, when a sudden ray of light blinds you, leaving you unable to proceed your action. You stumble on the ground covering your eyes
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You bravely close in on your enemy to engage him in an epic close quarter combat to the dead, when suddenly an unknown substance is thrown into your eyes. You scream in agony "my eyes, my eyes!"
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					you are blinded and can't see any more of your targets until you trow a DC10 (don't know what)

		<div class="items">
