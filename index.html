					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up, you realise it's growing out of control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but a surge of power makes you lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					The attack misses and you are knocked prone. Any subsequent targets this ability would hit are automatically missed.

				<h2>Intimidation</h2>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					You unleash divine wrath upon the enemy. Awed by your tremendous show of force, they suddenly become very aware of their own mortality.

				<p class="flavor arcane">
					Your magic power surges and the sound of your spell strikes fear into the heart of your enemies, compelling them to run while they still can.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					A heavy blow to the very skull of the enemy makes a dent they will not ever recover from. As you roar with rage, your enemies are crippled with fear.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					<span class="special">If your target is dead, apply to all their allies in a close blast 5 centerd on the original target.</span>
					<br />
					Make an additional attack [ 5 + lvl vs wil ], if it hits, target is affected by fear until the start of your next turn.
