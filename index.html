					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up inside you, you realise that it's growing beyond your control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but the sudden surge of power causes you to lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					The attack misses and you are knocked prone. Any subsequent targets this ability would hit are automatically missed.
