		<h1>Clarifications</h1>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states that "You grant combat advantage", this means until the start of your next turn unless otherwise specified.
		</p>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states that "The attack doesn't happen", that means apply damage or effects to the current target, or any subsequent targets. Any targets already hit are unaffected by this.
		</p>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states "you do maximum damage", this only applies for normal damage rolls, not for added rolls like backstab, extra critical damage from weapon, hunter's quarry and the like.
		</p>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states "you do double damage", roll normal damage (including all modifiers) and then double it. Do not add effects like backstab, extra critical damage from weapon, hunter's quarry and the like before doubling.

				<h2>Daft Moment</h2>
