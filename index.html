		<h1>Clarifications</h1>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states that "You grant combat advantage", this means until the start of your next turn unless otherwise specified.
		</p>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states that "The attack doesn't happen", that means do not apply damage or effects to the current target, or any subsequent targets. Any targets already hit are unaffected by this.
		</p>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states "you do maximum damage", this only applies for normal damage rolls, not for added rolls like backstab, extra critical damage from weapon, hunter's quarry and the like.
		</p>
		<p class="clarification">
			When it states "you do double damage", roll normal damage (including all modifiers) and then double it. Do not add effects like backstab, extra critical damage from weapon, hunter's quarry and the like before doubling.

			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overpower</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up, you realise it's growing out of control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but a surge of power makes you lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects). You grant combat advantage.  You are knocked prone.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Slip up</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					While stringing up your bow, you let the string slip from your hands. This causes your aim to be way off. One of your allies takes an arrow to the knee.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You let go of the sling way too early, and the projectile flies off in the direction of one of your allies. Fortunately, the sling was not yet spinning at full speed.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You spend too much time worrying about the spell and too little time focussing energy in the correct direction. A mental image of an ally pops into your mind.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and sizzles off into the direction of your closest ally. They take half damage, other effects of your attack do not apply to either your ally or your original target.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overconfidence</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You aim proudly at your foe, prepared to smite them with a single arrow. A feeling of shame overcomes you as you completely miss your target, your arrow not even going in its general direction.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You start swinging your weapon around to show off your skills and confidently strut towards your enemy. As you swing wide, your enemy easily dodges your attempt to hit and you shamefully slice nothing but air.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You proudly declare to your party that you will knock your enemies prone with enormous power in this single attack. Laughter arises from your party as your attempt at spell-weaving results in utter failure.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects).You grant combat advantage. You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls until you hit something due to a short-lived lack of confidence.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Greasy hands</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You make a grotesque attack with your weapon, only to find out your hands have been sweating too much. Before the strike lands, you lose grip of your weapon and send it flying.<br />
					<span class="special">To infinity, and beyond!</span>
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					Your light and swift strike would have cut your enemy clear in two. As you hear the sound of metal hitting the floor in the distance, you suddenly realise why your stroke had felt so light.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					As you prepare for the shot of a lifetime, the centrifugal power of the sling suddenly overcomes the power of friction between the sling itself and your fingers.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects). You launch your weapon 1[W] squares in the direction of your target. If your weapon lands on an enemy, they take 1d4 of damage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Daft Moment</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You are unable to think clearly and cannot focus on your spell. The frustration of this causes you to lose track of time as you stubbornly keep trying to cast the spell, and the spell does none the better for it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As you call upon divine providence to slay your enemies, nothing happens. You try to plead with your gods, but your prayers remain unanswered. For a moment, you simply stand there doubting yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you prepare to draw the power from the spirits of nature that is required for your next feat, you find it lacking. You focus so hard that, for a moment, you lose track of everything around you, but still, nothing happens.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects). You become unable to use any abilities besides basic attacks. You may spend a minor action to re-focus and get rid of this effect. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Unfavorable mixture</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					As you call on the elements to cast your next spell, you soon realise that you have made a horrible mistake in the composition. Unable to control it any longer, you are forced to cast it upon yourself to save your allies.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As your first plea for divine intervention wasn't granted, you selfishly call upon another god to slay the enemy before you. Instead, you are smitten by the fury of the original, for lack of loyalty.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you gather the energy from your surroundings, a disturbance makes your primal power to backfire, causing you to get hit by it yourself. 
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and is reflected back towards you. All damage and effects are to be applied only to yourself.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Sneeze</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					Mid-combat, you find yourself unable to suppress the urge to have a big sneeze. As snot covers your armor, you are forced to pause and lower your weapons for a second.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					Just as you start to cast your spell, your concentration gets drawn away. A huge explosion of snot signifies the failure of what would otherwise have been a sure hit.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
					As you start to focus inward on your mental energy. Suddenly, you lift your head, but instead of unleashing hell upon your enemies, you unleash a large wad of booger upon yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects). You grant combat advantage. You are unable to take any more actions this turn. You take 1 acid damage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Burn - Out</h2>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
					You feel your mind faltering, but you refuse to give in to such small things. You draw out all your remaining power to make a strong attack, but your mind can't handle the strain. Suddenly, everything goes dark...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					Your bond with nature is strong, but your technique is wavering and your spirit tired. You decide to press on and ignore your instincts. You are able to unleash one mighty blow, but then, everything fades away...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					Your devotion is unwavering, but your physical body cannot keep up with the divine energy flowing through it. You choose to ignore the earthly and channel up one final feat of divinity before your body finally gives in.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack deals maximum damage. Any subsequent targets take maximum damage. You fall unconscious (saving throw ends). You take a -1 penalty to all attack rolls until your next extended rest.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>King Arthur</h2>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					As you attack your enemy with full power, the attack is deflected, causing your blade to get stuck in a cavity in the ground near them...
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You charge into your enemy shouting "it's clobbering time!" while swinging your weapon wildly. It seems that control sometimes does matter. You face-plant into the ground and your weapon gets wedged in-between some rocks.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor empty">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects). You are disarmed. As a minor action during any turn, you can make a [DC 20 + &frac12; Level] Strength check. If it is successful, you pull your weapon back out of the ground.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Ricochet</h2>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You fire a shot with your sling towards one of your enemies but your lack of aim causes you to miss the target completely. The stone ricochets off of a wall and right back into your face.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You leap into battle; fearless as you are; but your weapon ricochets off your enemy's armor, causing you to smash your own foot.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You cast an arcane spell but you notice far too late that there is a disturbance in the energy. As you try to compensate, your spell turns against you as if of its own will.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses the target but hits you instead. You grant combat advantage. Apply all damage and effects to yourself, none to the enemy.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Twisted Ankle</h2>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You slide through the battlefield like a knife through butter. However, sudden pain overcomes you when you twist your ankle by turning too sharp.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					In a surge of battle rage, your weapon feels light as a feather, but as you make a wide swing, your feet can scarcely handle the weight and power. You twist your ankle and stumble.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
					After focussing, you lunge forward with your ability at the ready, but do so too enthusiastically. A sharp pain shoots up from your leg and you feel your ankle giving out under the strain.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects). You grant combat advantage. You are slowed for 10 rounds, Make a Dexterity check DC 20. Success: nothing happens; Failure: fall prone.

			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Shocked</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					While you aim for your foe, they make an unexpected move towards you. You cower backwards in surprise and shock as your pants look like a gnome just used a soil spell on them.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You prepare to launch a bullet at the enemy, but they make a move you had not expected. Suddenly ripped from your concentration, you literally shit your pants in surprise and are forced to take a step backwards.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you gather the strength to strike out at an enemy, they make a sudden move you had not expected. Instinctively, you quickly jump backward as you unleash a spurt of waste from your behind.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack doesn't happen (don't apply miss effects). You are forced to move 1sq away from your target if possible. During your movement, up to one enemy except your target can make an attack of opportunity.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Bad timing</h2>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					As you reach for ammo to load your sling, you realise that
					you have completely forgotten to replenish it after the last fight.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					As you try to swing your blade, it gets tangled in a loose
					strap hanging from you armor. Even the enemy looks amused as you desperately try to free your weapon. 
				</p>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					As you ready your shot, you suddenly hear a loud snap
					coming from your bow. It seems that the string has come loose on one side.  
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					You fail to do an attack this turn. You are unable to use your current weapon or implement for 1d4 rounds as you prepare yourself for battle again. You grant combat advantage during this period of time.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Haughtiness</h2>
				<p class="flavor divine">

				</p>
				<p class="flavor psionic">
					After some successful battles, it has finally gone to your head. As you move across the battlefield like you're the best thing since sliced bread, you stumble awkwardly. Haughtiness does come before a fall.

			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Failed theatrics</h2>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					In your bravado, you swing your sling around and perform a little trick by twirling it over your head. However, your armor impairs your arm movement and you smack your sling straight into your left eye.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					In an attempt to look like some kind of badass Legolas, you draw your bow to your chest instead of to your shoulder. You underestimate the strength required for this feat and lose your grip on the bow, which promptly smacks into your face.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					In order to look extra cool, you decide to expend some of the energy you would normally use for your spell, to make yourself light up. You use way too much energy for effect and even end up blinding yourself in the process.
