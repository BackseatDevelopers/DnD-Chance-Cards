		<h1>Fumbles</h1>
		<div class="items">
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overpower</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up, you realise it's growing out of control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but a surge of power makes you lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and you are knocked prone. Any subsequent targets this ability would hit are automatically missed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Slip up</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					While stringing up your bow, you let the string slip from your hands. This causes your aim to be way off. One of your allies takes an arrow to the knee.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You let go of the sling way too early, and the projectile flies off in the direction of one of your allies. Fortunately, the sling was not yet spinning at full speed.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You spend too much time worrying about the spell and too little time focussing energy in the correct direction. A mental image of an ally pops into your mind.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					The attack misses and sizzles off into the direction of your closest ally. They take half damage, other effects of your attack do not apply.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Cut the Cheese</h2>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
					As you prepare to make your strike, suddenly, your bowels rebel. You let out a righteous fart whose sound echoes through the area like a horn blast in a valley. Shocked, you abort your attack and take a moment to recover.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor any">
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses. Make a secondary attack: close burst 7; Allies and enemies that have noses; Level vs. Fortitude; Hit: target must use a movement action of their next turn to move at least 3sq away from you if they can.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overconfidence</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You proudly aim at your foe, prepared to smite them down with a single arrow. A feeling of shame overcomes you as you completely miss your target, your arrow not even going in its general direction.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					You start swinging your weapon around to show off your skills and confidently strut towards your enemy. As you swing wide, your enemy easily dodges your attempt to hit and you shamefully slice into the air.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You proudly declare to your party that you will knock your enemies prone with enormous power in this single attack. Laughter arises from your party as your attack your attempt at spell-weaving results in utter failure.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Your attack misses this and any subsequent targets. You take a -2 penalty on your next attack roll due to a short-lived lack of confidence.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Greasy hands</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You make a grotesque attack with your weapon, only to find out your hands been sweating too much. Before the strike lands, you lose grip of your weapon and send it flying to infinity, and beyond.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					Your light and swift strike would have cut your enemy clear in two. As you hear the sound of metal hitting the floor in the distance, you suddenly realise why your stroke had felt so light.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					As you prepare for the shot of a lifetime, the centrifugal power of the sling suddenly overcomes the power of friction between the sling itself and your fingers.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">

				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Daft Moment</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You are unable to think clearly and cannot focus on your spell. The frustration of this causes you to lose track of time as you stubbornly keep trying to cast the spell, and the spell does none the better for it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As you call upon divine providence to slay your enemies, nothing happens. You try to plead with your gods, but your prayers remain unanswered. For a moment, you simply stand there doubting yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you prepare to draw the power from the spirits of nature that is required for your next feat, you find it lacking. You focus so hard that, for a moment, you lose track of everything around you, but still, nothing happens.
				</p>
				<p class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you become unable to use any abilities besides basic attacks. You may spend a minor action to re-focus and get rid of this effect.

				</p>

				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Sneeze</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					Mid-combat, you find yourself unable to suppress the urge to have a big sneeze. As snot covers your armor, you are forced to pause and lower your weapons for a second.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					Just as you start to cast your spell, your concentration gets drawn away. A huge explosion of snot signifies the failure of what would have been a sure hit.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor psionic">

				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">

				</p>

				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					In a surge of battle rage, your weapon feels light as a feather, but as you make a wide swing, your feet can scarcely handle the weight and power. You twist your ankle and stumble.
