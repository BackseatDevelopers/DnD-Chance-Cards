		<h1>Fumbles</h1>
		<div class="items">
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Overpower</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					You string up the bow with all your might to release a hefty shot, but alas, your string touches your hip as you release. The shot misses and the force from the bow causes you to stumble and fall.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You strike out at your foe with the might of a giant. Your swing is too wide, however, and misses the target. This causes you to lose balance and trip over your own feet.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You pour all your arcane might into the spell. As you feel the power welling up, you realise it's growing out of control. You abort the spell just before it implodes, but a surge of power makes you lose your balance and stumble.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					The attack misses and you are knocked prone. Any subsequent targets this ability would hit are automatically missed.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Slip up</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					While stringing up your bow, you let the string slip from your hands. This causes your aim to be way off. One of your allies takes an arrow to the knee.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					You let go of the sling way too early, and the projectile flies off in the direction of one of your allies. Fortunately, the sling was not yet spinning at full speed.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You spend too much time worrying about the spell and too little time focussing energy in the correct direction. A mental image of an ally pops into your mind.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					The attack misses and sizzles off into the direction of your closest ally. They take half damage, other effects of your attack do not apply.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Greasy hands</h2>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					You make a grotesque attack with your weapon, only to find out your hands been sweating too much. Before the strike lands, you lose grip of your weapon and send it flying to infinity, and beyond.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					Your light and swift strike would have cut your enemy clear in two. As you hear the sound of metal hitting the floor in the distance, you suddenly realise why your stroke had felt so light.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					As you prepare for the shot of a lifetime, the centrifugal power of the sling suddenly overcomes the power of friction between the sling itself and your fingers.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you launch your weapon [W] squares in the direction of your target. If your weapon lands on an enemy, they take 1d4 of damage.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Daft Moment</h2>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					You are unable to think clearly and cannot focus on your spell. The frustration of this causes you to lose track of time as you stubbornly keep trying to cast the spell, and the spell does none the better for it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					As you call upon divine providence to slay your enemies, nothing happens. You try to plead with your gods, but your prayers remain unanswered. For a moment, you simply stand there doubting yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor primal">
					As you prepare to draw the power from the spirits of nature that is required for your next feat, you find it lacking. You focus so hard that, for a moment, you lose track of everything around you, but still, nothing happens.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Your attack misses and you become unable to use any abilities besides basic attacks. You may spend a minor action to re-focus and get rid of this effect.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h1>Criticals</h1>
		<div class="items">
			<div class="item">
				<h2>Intimidation</h2>
				<p class="flavor divine">
					You unleash divine wrath upon the enemy. Awed by your tremendous show of force, they suddenly become very aware of their own mortality.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor arcane">
					Your magic power surges and the sound of your spell strikes fear into the heart of your enemies, compelling them to run while they still can.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blunt">
					A heavy blow to the very skull of the enemy makes a dent they will not ever recover from. As you roar with rage, your enemies are crippled with fear.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					<span class="special">If the target is dead, use area burst 2 centered on target.</span>
					<br />
					Make an attack: Level vs. Will. Hit: target is affected by fear until the start of your next turn.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h2>The flow of battle</h2>
				<p class="flavor bow">
					As you notice your arrow going straight for its mark, you confidently draw up and aim the next one without even thinking about it.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor blade">
					As your blade cleanly slices through the enemy's abdomen, you use the motion of your swing to prepare your next strike.
				</p>
				<p class="flavor sling">
					After releasing the bullet from your sling, you reload it with a swift sleight of hand, preparing your next attack in no time.
				</p>
				<div class="effect">
					Until the end of your next turn, you may use a minor action as a free action once.
				</div>
